## What is an algorithm and why should you care?
An __algorithm__ is a step by step method of solving a problem.
It is commonly used for data processing, calculation and other related computer and mathematical operations.
An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task.
This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file.
In computer programming, algorithms are often created as functions.

## What is recursion?
__Recursion__ is an important programming technique, in which a function calls itself.


---
<br>
## What is data, data structure?
__Data structure__
is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
More precisely, a _data structure_ is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

<br>
## What is OOP?
__Objected-oriented programming__ (OOP)
refers to a programming methodology based on objects, instead of functions and procedures.
These objects are organized into classes, which allow individual objects to be group together.


---
<br>
## Prototype-based programming
__Prototype-based programming__ is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined,
but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, add them to an empty object.

In simple words, this type of style allows creating an object, without defining its class.
