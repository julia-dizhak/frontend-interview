### Doctype
DOCTYPE describes the type of HTML. While there are technically different types, for 99.999% of the HTML you'll write `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
Browsers look for this doctype declaration to determine which rendering mode to use to render the web site.

### structure
<head>: Describes meta information about the site, such as the title, and provides links to scripts and stylesheets the site needs to render and behave correctly.
<body>: Describes the actual content of the site that users will see.

### What is the difference between block and inline elements?
_p_ - a big block of text that is separate from other pieces of text

__block__ is a block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container). Browsers typically display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element.

_span_ is line of text, isnâ€™t really separate from other pieces of text.

__inline element__
an inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary; only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
